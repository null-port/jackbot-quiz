# 📃 JackBot Quiz  
## *An interactive game to compare human and AI-generated comedy*

Can an AI be funny? I sure think so.

This interactive quiz challenges players to guess whether a **Quiplash** answer was written by a human or by [**JackBot**](https://github.com/null-port/jackbot), an AI fine-tuned to generate comedic responses.

Note: All answers have been pre-generated and are not inferenced live. If you're interested, you can find the model [here](https://huggingface.co/nullport/Jackbot).
